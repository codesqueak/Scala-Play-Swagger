## Swagger UI
This link opens the swagger UI in a running project. Unfortunately it defaults the Petstore Demo (why?).

Once opened, change the location from `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` to `/swagger.json`

## Swagger JSON
This link opens the generated Swagger JSON document in a running project
